Does it feel like time is moving strangely during this semester?

For our first Pi project, we will pay homage to the [timekeeping devices of old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_timekeeping_devices) by making simple clocks.

It is worth spending a little time thinking about how you mark time, and what would be useful in a clock of your own design.

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab here.**
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

## Prep

1. ### Set up your Lab 2 Github

At the start of lab Wednesday, ensure you have the latest lab content by updating your forked repository. 

**📖 [Follow the step-by-step guide for safely updating your fork](pull_updates/README.md)**

This guide covers how to pull updates without overwriting your completed work, handle merge conflicts, and recover if something goes wrong.


2. ### Get Kit and Inventory Parts
Take inventory of the kit parts that you have, and note anything that is missing:

***Update your [parts list inventory](partslist.md)***

3. ### Prepare your Pi for lab this week
[Follow these instructions](prep.md) to download and burn the image for your Raspberry Pi before lab Wednesday.




## Overview
For this assignment, you are going to 

A) [Connect to your Pi](#part-a)  

B) [Try out cli_clock.py](#part-b) 

C) [Set up your RGB display](#part-c)

D) [Try out clock_display_demo](#part-d) 

E) [Modify the code to make the display your own](#part-e)

F) [Make a short video of your modified barebones PiClock](#part-f)

G) [Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock for Part 2.](#part-g)

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the \*\*\***stars**\*\*\*. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Sunday midnight. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. 
### Connect to your Pi
Just like you did in the lab prep, ssh on to your pi. Once you get there, create a Python environment (named venv) by typing the following commands.

```
ssh pi@<your Pi's IP address>
...
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python -m venv venv
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ 

```
### Setup Personal Access Tokens on GitHub
Set your git name and email so that commits appear under your name.
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourNetID@cornell.edu"
```

**The Personal Access Token on Git and the Python Environment have been created**

## Part B. 
### Try out the Command Line Clock

## Part C. 
### Set up your RGB Display

## Part D. 
### Set up the Display Clock Demo

## Part E. Read Part 2. Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock.

**Put the names of the people you gave feedback to here. (Even better, add links to their repos here!)**

# Lab 2 Part 2

## Prep 

1. Pick up remaining parts for kit on Wednesday lab class. Check the updated [parts list inventory](partslist.md) and let the TA know if there is any part missing.

2. Look at and give feedback on the Part E. for at least 3 other people in the class and get 3 people to comment on your Part E!)
**Put the feedback for your ideas here.**

## Update your Lab Hub

[Update your Lab Hub](pull_updates/README.md) to get the latest content and requirements for Part 2.

## Modify the barebones clock to make it your own

Start small, pick just one element of your overall idea, just to show you have a handle on the code and components.

\*\*\***Put a copy of your code in your Lab 2 Github repo.**\*\*\*

## Make a short video of your modified barebones PiClock

\*\*\***Take a video of your barely modified PiClock.**\*\*\*

After you edit and work on the scripts for Lab 2, the files should be upload back to your own GitHub repo! You can push to your personal github repo by adding the files here, commiting and pushing.

```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ git add .
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ git commit -m 'your commit message here'
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ git push
```

After that, Git will ask you to login to your GitHub account to push the updates online, you will be asked to provide your GitHub user name and password. Remember to use the "Personal Access Tokens" you set up in Part A as the password instead of your account one! Go on your GitHub repo with your laptop, you should be able to see the updated files from your Pi!

## Now, make your own PiClock

Do take advantage of having done the previous iteration to refine and simplify your design.

** Insert any updates ideas, sketches, [Verplank diagrams](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a-fall-2004/IDSketchbok.pdf))!, storyboards for your ideas **


\*\*\***Put a copy of your code in your Lab 2 Github repo.**\*\*\*

\*\*\***Take a video of your PiClock.**\*\*\*


As always, make sure you document contributions and ideas from others (and AI) explicitly in your writeup.

You are permitted (but not required) to work in groups and share a turn in; you are expected to make equal contribution on any group work you do, and N people's group project should look like N times the work of a single person's lab.  Make sure the page for the group turn in is linked to your personal Interactive Lab Hub page.
